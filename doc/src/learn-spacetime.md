# Learn Spacetime

Please [install spacetime](getting-started.md) first to run the program of this section.

## Running a first program

In this section, we compile a first spacetime program in a Java project.
Go to the toy project available at [examples/bonsai/HelloWorld](https://github.com/ptal/bonsai/tree/master/examples/bonsai/HelloWorld) and launch the following script:

```sh
./run.sh
```

It compiles and runs the code.
It prints the message `HelloWorld` 5 times:

```
Hello world!
1
Hello world!
2
Hello world!
3
Hello world!
4
5
```

You can start from this code to modify it.
The standard library of spacetime is usable and you can find different modules in the directory [libstd](https://github.com/ptal/bonsai/tree/master/libstd/src/main/java/bonsai).
