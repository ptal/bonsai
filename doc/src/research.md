# Companion guides to research papers

For each paper written about spacetime, I maintain a companion guide in order to:

1. Provide instructions to install the exact same version of the language than the one used in the paper.
2. Help people who wants to execute the examples presented in the paper.
3. Replicate the benchmarks with a single command.
